                <h1>MINUTIAE</h1>
                <p>There’s nothing Cal doesn’t know, including the ability to predict the future, except who he is and why strangers want him dead.<br><br>Cal has no memory of his identity, his life, or the events preceding waking up alone in the middle of an Ohio cornfield. He soon realizes, however, that he has abilities that separate him from the rest of humanity. Along with a flawless eidetic memory and an all-encompassing awareness of the most minute details, he perceives patterns so complex it provides him the superhuman ability to predict events before they happen.<br><br>Filled with the struggle against a clandestine agency with infinite reach and resources, an enigmatic counterpart that is Cal’s equal in all but his obstacles, and unlikely allies obtained seemingly by chance, Minutiae follows Cal through an intricate web of conspiracy, action, suffering, tragedy, and hope that—if survived—will yield the answers to the question of Cal’s ultimate destiny. Flailing to master his emerging gifts fast enough to stay ahead of those who hunt him, Cal knows his only sure path to the future lies in the discovery of his past…</p>
